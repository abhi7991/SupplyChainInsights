![alt text](Files/logo-color.png)

## [Overview](Files/ProjectOverview.pdf)

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing global health commodity supply chains, specifically Antiretroviral (ARV) and HIV lab shipments. The project utilizes neo4j graph databases, advanced graph data science techniques, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for enhanced data exploration and insights.

## [Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/supply-chain-shipment-pricing-data-07d29)
The dataset used in this project provides comprehensive information on supply chain health commodity shipments and pricing. It includes data on ARV and HIV lab shipments to supported countries, along with commodity pricing, supply chain expenses, and volumes delivered by country.

## Key Features

- Neo4j Graph Database: Constructs a graph database to model and analyze supply chain relationships.
- Graph Data Science: Utilizes graph algorithms and queries for supply chain analysis and visualization.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Implements RAG for enhanced data retrieval and user interaction.
